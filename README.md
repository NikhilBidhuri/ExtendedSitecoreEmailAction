# ExtendedSitecoreEmailAction

Create a .Net project and one item with username, password and port fields

To maintain organization and cleanliness, I have established an Email Configuration Item within Sitecore under the System Node. This item is used to store all the UserName, App Password and Port.

Take the code and build it, deploy the dll and use SMTP which require IMR account login to send workflow automated mails.
